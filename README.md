# Bryan Jones's "Boilerplates"

Heyo!

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I showcase my undying love for all things hardware, software, and automation. I may not be the most experienced coder, but I make up for it with my sheer determination and willingness to hack and derp my way through any problem. Whether it's soldering together a circuit board or automating the infrastructure deployment using tools like terraform, ansible. I'll stop at nothing to make my projects a reality. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the chaos that is my journey through the world of technology."
